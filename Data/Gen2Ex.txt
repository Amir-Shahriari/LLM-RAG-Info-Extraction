The experiment involves 200 high school students split into two groups. One group uses AI-driven personalized learning tools, while the other follows traditional methods. Both complete the same math curriculum over a semester. Academic performance is measured with tests before and after, while engagement is tracked via surveys and observations. The results compare the impact of personalized AI learning against traditional instruction.
