Participant Selection:

Recruit 100 adults aged 25-50.
Split the participants into two groups:
Experimental group: Engages in 30 minutes of aerobic exercise (e.g., running or cycling) 5 times a week for 12 weeks.
Control group: No regular exercise during the same period.
Cognitive Function Tests:

Measure participants' baseline cognitive abilities using a standardized battery of cognitive tests (focusing on memory recall, problem-solving, and executive control).
Administer the same tests at intervals: before starting the regimen, at 6 weeks, and at the end of 12 weeks.
Physiological Measurements:

Track physical health improvements (heart rate, VO2 max) in the exercise group to ensure that aerobic capacity is improving alongside cognitive measures.


Regular aerobic exercise enhances cognitive function, especially in tasks involving memory and executive control, in adults between the ages of 25 and 50.

Cognitive Test Scores:

Over the 12-week period, participants in the experimental group show an improvement in memory recall and executive function tasks compared to their baseline scores.
The control group shows little to no improvement or a slight decline in cognitive function over time.
Physiological Improvement:

The experimental group shows increased aerobic capacity (measured through VO2 max) and lower resting heart rates, indicating enhanced physical fitness.
Qualitative Feedback:

Some participants in the experimental group report feeling more alert and focused in daily tasks, while control group participants report no significant changes.

The experimental group exhibits a statistically significant improvement in cognitive function compared to the control group. The improvements are particularly noticeable in memory-related tasks and tasks requiring executive control (like planning and problem-solving).
The correlation between improved physical fitness and cognitive enhancement supports the idea that aerobic exercise boosts brain function.

The experiment supports the hypothesis that regular aerobic exercise improves cognitive function in adults aged 25-50. The increase in cognitive abilities, particularly in memory and executive control, can be attributed to the positive effects of physical activity on brain health. Hence, aerobic exercise should be considered a beneficial intervention for enhancing cognitive performance in adults.
